# AminoReader

AminoReader is a free, open-source, and user-friendly program to read aminoacids sequence written in Python and Kivy. 
Kivy is a Python library which can be used to create applications on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS with 
GUI framework (Graphical User Interface).

AminoReader provides flexible, three options for loading a file.  
For instance, the row file contains the sequence of codons that can be uploaded. Moreover, it also allows to 
load a file consisting of aminoacids sequence in one-character and three-character notation.

AminoReader also provides mass calculation and isoelectric point (pI) of investigated protein. 
Isoelectric point (pI) is a pH in which the net charge of the protein is zero. 
In the case of proteins, the isoelectric point mostly depends on seven charged amino acids:
glutamate, aspartate, cysteine, tyrosine, histidine, lysine, and arginine.

The repository contains example files in the docs folder, appropriate to every three options of loading: 
codon_notation.txt, aminoacid_one_character.txt, aminoacid_three_character.txt, respectively.
